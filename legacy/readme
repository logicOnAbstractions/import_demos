js import demos
------------------

node module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* what I'm doing in /node_modules/app2 & circle2.js won't work in node.
* this is because the nice article from  `the guy <https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2020/07/16/an-introduction-on-how-to-export-and-import-javascript-modules/>`_ is talking about ECMASCRIPT imp/ex, not node
* for NODE, that syntax is experimentale. you can use it, but you NEED the module thingy. c.f. /ecmascript_exports exemples.
* therefore my node_module package/exeamples will need to focus on the node-stable imp/ex, e.g what is `here <https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html>`_
